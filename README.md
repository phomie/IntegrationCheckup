 <h2>Collect data from a website that is open headless with Google Puppeteer </h2>

 <h3>
 Puppeteer is a Node library that provides a high-level API to control headless browsers, such as Google Chrome or Chromium.<br>
It allows you to automate tasks related to browser interaction, such as generating screenshots, crawling websites, and testing.<br>
Background: This tool was created to automate daily tasks. When a website was assigned to the marketing network, the integrated advertising technology must be controlled in the same way. <br>
Some of the colleagues weren't familiar with working with browser devtools. To simplify that, they needed only the URL of the website and received the data in a couple of seconds.
